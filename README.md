# mycc — a tiny C-subset compiler

This is my own compiler project, inspired by ["A Compiler Writing Journey"](https://github.com/DoctorWkt/acwj).

### Goals
- Build a compiler step by step (lexer → parser → semantic analysis → codegen).
- Document progress and decisions.
- Add my own features beyond the tutorial.

### Build
```sh
make
